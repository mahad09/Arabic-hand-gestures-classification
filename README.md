# Arabic-hand-gestures-classification
Hand gesture recognition using CNNs. Using the dataset to train the best known network for gesture classification on images with just one hand. Testing hyper-parameters and preprocessing techniques to improve the performance.

Steps to run the code:

1)Place the dataset directory namely 'augmented_dataset' in the root directory of the project.
2)Run the command 'python3 main.py' from the terminal window OR run the 'main.py' in any IDE to kick-start the code execution.

NOTE: 'data_augmentation.py' is only executed when you don't have the augmented dataset. It is more important to note that the names of dataset directories or folders must match with the names defined in the code. 

Thank.
